Description
-----------
Discriminate between VBF and non-VBF production modes of pp -> H --> 4l events 
using one-sided cuts.

First define environment variables by "sourcing" the setup scripts from the
RGS directory:

    cd RGS
    source setup.sh   (for a bash shell)
    
(A) Run RGS
    python train.py

output:
    example0.root
    example0.txt

(B) Analyze results of RGS to find best cuts
    python analysis.py
